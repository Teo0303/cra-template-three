# cra-template-three

This is my custom framework for building ReactJS + ThreeJS Projects. Please keep in mind that this template is on its early stages of development. Don't expect it to be polished yet.

- Source: [cra-template-three](https://github.com/mgzme/cra-template-three)

## Creating a project with it:
`npx create-react-app <project_name> --template cra-template-three`

After that, enter your project's directory and run:

`yarn setup`

... to take care of installing all the devDependencies (for now, Create React App project still blacklists devDependencies for templates 🙁)

For more information about Create React App, please refer to:

- [Getting Started](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) – How to create a new app.
- [User Guide](https://create-react-app.dev) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.
