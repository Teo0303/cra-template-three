## Available Scripts

This Create React App template uses [CRACO](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco) to customize WebPack configurations, so the usual Create React App start, test and build scripts are custom ones. In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn setup`

This is supposed to be executed just a single time, right after the creation of your React App. It takes care of the devDependencies, as for now (04/2020), Create React App still blacklists devDependencies for templates.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

Your app is ready to be deployed!
